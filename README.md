# oeis

The goal of this project is to implement as many [OEIS](oeis.org) sequences as possible- quantity over quality.


At the time of writing I have implemented just shy of 2000 sequences, out of 380'000.


The test suite verifies that the implementations are correct for the first ten numbers, and also report
implementations that are unreasonably slow.
