				"The initial cm 0-9 can each be labeled because the labels take up one cm each, but the label for cm 10 takes up 2 cm, so cm 11 does not have its own label. Now 12 is labeled. This continues until cm 100 is labeled, which takes up 3 spaces, so 101 and 102 do not have their own label. - _John Cerkan_, Feb 14 2017",
				"Or, let a'(n) be the length of all previous numbers in a(n), concatenated, then a(n) is a list of all the digits of each term of a'(n). - _John Cerkan_, Feb 16 2017"
