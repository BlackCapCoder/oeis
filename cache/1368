				"Lenition letters (lowercase h) are omitted in the count, thus \"hocht\" for 8 is considered to be \"oct\" with a letter count 3.  Likewise, the particle \"a\" usually added to spoken numbers is omitted in the count, thus \"fiche a do\" for 22 is considered to be \"fice do\" with a letter count 6. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jun 27 2012"
