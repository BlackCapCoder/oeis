				"\"At lunch one day, feeling even more ebullient than usual, he [Richard Feynman] challenged the table to a competition. He bet that he could solve any problem within sixty seconds, to within ten percent accuracy, that could be stated within ten seconds. ... Under pressure, his friends found themselves unable to stump him. ... Then Paul Olum spoke up. ... He demanded the tangent of ten to the hundredth. The competition was over. ... Even Feynman could not produce that on short notice.\" [James Gleick, Genius, Pantheon, NY, 1992, p. 178.] - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 25 2018"
