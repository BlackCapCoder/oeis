			"comment": [
				"From _Markus Voege_, Nov 24 2009: (Start)",
				"On the difference between this sequence and A038147:",
				"The first term that differs is for n=6; for all subsequent terms, the number of polyhexes is larger than the number of planar polyhexes.",
				"If I recall correctly, polyhexes are clusters of regular hexagons that are joined at the edges and are LOCALLY embeddable in the hexagonal lattice.",
				"\"Planar polyhexes\" are polyhexes that are GLOBALLY embeddable in the honeycomb lattice.",
				"Example: (Planar) polyhex with 6 cells (x) and a hole (O):",
				".. x x",
				". x O x",
				".. x x",
				"Polyhex with 6 cells that is cut open (I):",
				".. xIx",
				". x O x",
				".. x x",
				"This polyhex is not globally embeddable in the honeycomb lattice, since adjacent cells of the lattice must be joined. But it can be embedded locally everywhere. It is a start of a spiral. For n\u003e6 the spiral can be continued so that the cells overlap.",
				"Illegal configuration with cut (I):",
				".. xIx",
				". x x x",
				".. x x",
				"This configuration is NOT a polyhex since the vertex at",
				".. xIx",
				"... x",
				"is not embeddable in the honeycomb lattice.",
				"One has to keep in mind that these definitions are inspired by chemistry. Hence, potential molecules are often the motivation for these definitions. Think of benzene rings that are fused at a C-C bond.",
				"The (planar) polyhexes are \"free\" configurations, in contrast to \"fixed\" configurations as in A001207 = Number of fixed hexagonal polyominoes with n cells.",
				"A000228 (planar polyhexes) and A001207 (fixed polyominoes) differ only by the attribute \"free\" vs. \"fixed,\" that is, whether the different orientations and reflections of an embedding in the lattice are counted.",
				"The configuration",
				". x x .... x",
				".. x .... x x",
				"is counted once as free and twice as fixed configurations.",
				"Since most configurations have no symmetry, (A001207 / A000228) -\u003e 12 for n -\u003e infinity. (End)"
