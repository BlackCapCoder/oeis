				"Rabung and Jordan (1970) incorrectly computed a(8) as 399: their placement of residues supporting a(8)=399 fails since 80 and 81 fall into the same 8th-power residue class. - _Max Alekseyev_, Aug 10 2005",
				"_Don Reble_ pointed out that for even n, the n-th residue class placement of prime factors q of n must obey the quadratic reciprocity law: q must be in an even class whenever n*(q-1) is a multiple of 8. - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 04 2017"
