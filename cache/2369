				"Is this an erroneous version of A056780? It is unclear why one of the 9 polyominoes counted in A056780(4) should be omitted here. Devisme writes in his article that errors are likely and he cannot guarantee the exact figures but only \"the order of magnitude\". - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 24 2018",
				"This is different from A056780 because the polyominoes can split off (beginning at A056780(4)) while a strip of stamps always has 2 ends. - _Eric Fox_, Sep 01 2019"
