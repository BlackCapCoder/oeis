Furthermore, all terms here are positive, whereas the terms of A000367 retain the sign of B_{2n}, e.g., a(8)/A002444(8) = 10851/1530 is the absolute value of A000367(8)/A002445(8) = -3617/510 = B_{16}. - _M.

Note that the recurrence for c_{2k} involves an extra term c_1 = 1 (which is not a term of the present sequence), and also the numbers M_i^{2k} given in A266743. However, given that contemporary Computer Algebra Systems can easily calculate Bernoulli numbers, and A002444 has a simple formula, the best way to compute a(n) today is via a(n) = A002444(n)*|B_{2n}|.  - _N.
