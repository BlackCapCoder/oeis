				"A conference matrix of order n is an n X n {-1,0,+1} matrix A such that A A' = (n-1)I.",
				"If n == 2 (mod 4) then a necessary condition is that n-1 is a sum of 2 squares (A286636). It is conjectured that this condition is also sufficient. If n == 2 mod 4 and n-1 is a prime or prime power the condition is automatically satisfied."
