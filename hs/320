It's also natural to generalize the idea of \"basis\" so as to cover the likes of F[n]2, the so-called \"fibbinary\" numbers (A003714) and provide standard ready-made images of entities obeying other arithmetics, say like GF2[n]2 (e.g., primes = A014580, squares = the present sequence, etc.). - _Marc LeBrun_, Mar 24 2005",
