				"This sequence counts the \"almost triangular\" partitions of n. A partition is triangular if it is of the form 0+1+2+...+k. Examples: 3=0+1+2, 6=0+1+2+3. An \"almost triangular\" partition is a triangular partition with at most 1 added to each of the parts. Examples: 7 = 1+1+2+3 = 0+2+2+3 = 0+1+3+3 = 0+1+2+4. Thus a(7)=4. 8 = 1+2+2+3 = 1+1+3+3 = 1+1+2+4 = 0+2+3+3 = 0+2+2+4 = 0+1+3+4 so a(8)=6. - _Moshe Shmuel Newman_, Dec 19 2002",
